The Deep Learning Architecture is based on the one published by Hoelzemann et al. : 
https://github.com/ahoelzemann/deepconvlstm_keras.

We adapted the architecture according to our needs as described in our paper.
Please cite the paper linked in the repository if you decide to work with that archecture.
